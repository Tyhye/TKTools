**Here are some useful tools for myself.**

I will share some tools which are coded in python with tkinter.

## ClassLabel

**ClassLabel** is a tool for label files. Now it's could show img and video. 

1. You could use run the tool from the source: **$> python classlabel.py** 
2. You also could pack the tool to a **.exe** or **.app** by pyinstaller: **$> pyinstaller -F -w classlabel.py** 
3. If you pack the tool, you **have to** copy the **opencv_ffmpeg???_??.dll** to your pack directory. Because the Pyinstaller can't pack the **opencv_ffmpeg** auto.
